The key requirements I\\'ve gathered are:\\\\n\\\\n1. You are using a Mac operating system\\\\n2. You are looking for the standard way to shut down your laptop\\\\n3. You are not experiencing any issues with the normal shutdown process\\\\n4. You don\\'t need information about alternative power states like sleep or hibernate\\\\n5. There are no specific circumstances or constraints to consider (such as preserving work or battery concerns)\\\\n\\\\nYour need appears to be straightforward - you simply want to know the standard procedure to properly shut down your Mac laptop.

Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods. By following this document, you will achieve a medium-spiced Chicken 65 with minimal oil usage while maintaining the dish\\'s essential characteristics and serving 4-5 people effectively.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want to turn off my laptop.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

The strategy focuses on maintaining authentic flavors while adapting the traditional deep-frying method to a healthier air fryer approach.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Key Requirements:\\\\n- Prepare Chicken 65\\\\n- Medium spice level\\\\n- Yield: 4-5 servings\\\\n- Cooking method: Air fryer\\\\n- Minimal oil usage\\\\n\\\\n### Constraints:\\\\n- Must retain authentic Chicken 65 flavor profile\\\\n- Must achieve proper texture (crispy exterior, juicy interior)\\\\n- Must accommodate medium spice tolerance\\\\n- Must be efficiently prepared using an air fryer\\\\n\\\\n## Ingredient Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Primary Ingredients:\\\\n- **Chicken:** 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes\\\\n- **Marinade Base:**\\\\n  - 1 cup plain yogurt\\\\n  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\\\n  - 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste\\\\n  - 1 teaspoon salt\\\\n\\\\n### Spice Components (Medium Level):\\\\n- 1.5 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (provides color with moderate heat)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon regular red chili powder (can be adjusted \\xc2\\xb10.5 tsp for spice preference)\\\\n- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala\\\\n- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper\\\\n\\\\n### Coating Components:\\\\n- 3 tablespoons corn starch or rice flour\\\\n- 1 egg (beaten)\\\\n\\\\n### Oil Usage Strategy:\\\\n- 2 tablespoons oil for marination\\\\n- Cooking spray for air fryer basket\\\\n\\\\n### Tempering/Garnish Components:\\\\n- 1 tablespoon oil\\\\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (optional)\\\\n- 10-12 curry leaves\\\\n- 2 green chilies, slit (optional - for authentic appearance)\\\\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\\\\n- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\\\\n- Chopped cilantro for garnish\\\\n- Lemon wedges for serving\\\\n\\\\n## Process Flow Diagram\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n[Chicken Preparation] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Marination (4+ hours)] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Add Coating] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Air Fry] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Optional Tempering] \\xe2\\x86\\x92 [Garnish and Serve]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Detailed Process Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 1: Preparation and Marination\\\\n1. **Chicken Preparation:**\\\\n   - Clean and pat dry chicken pieces\\\\n   - Cut into 1-inch cubes for even cooking\\\\n   - Ensure uniform size for consistent cooking\\\\n\\\\n2. **Marination:**\\\\n   - Combine all marinade and spice components in a large bowl\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to create a uniform marinade\\\\n   - Add chicken pieces and coat completely\\\\n   - Cover and refrigerate for minimum 4 hours (preferably overnight)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 2: Air Fryer Execution\\\\n1. **Pre-Cooking Preparation:**\\\\n   - Preheat air fryer to 380\\xc2\\xb0F (193\\xc2\\xb0C) for 3 minutes\\\\n   - Remove marinated chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Add corn starch/rice flour and beaten egg to marinated chicken\\\\n   - Mix thoroughly to ensure even coating\\\\n\\\\n2. **Air Frying Process:**\\\\n   - Lightly spray air fryer basket with cooking spray\\\\n   - Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer with small gaps between pieces\\\\n   - Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding\\\\n   - Air fry at 380\\xc2\\xb0F for 12 minutes\\\\n   - Flip chicken pieces halfway through cooking (at 6-minute mark)\\\\n   - Check internal temperature (should reach 165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C)\\\\n\\\\n### Phase 3: Optional Tempering (For Authentic Finish)\\\\n1. **Tempering Preparation:**\\\\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan\\\\n   - Add mustard seeds and let them splutter\\\\n   - Add dried red chilies, curry leaves, green chilies, and minced garlic\\\\n   - Saut\\xc3\\xa9 for 30 seconds until aromatic\\\\n\\\\n2. **Final Assembly:**\\\\n   - Transfer air-fried chicken to a mixing bowl\\\\n   - Pour the tempering mixture over the chicken\\\\n   - Toss gently to coat evenly\\\\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro\\\\n   - Serve hot with lemon wedges\\\\n\\\\n## Key Performance Indicators\\\\n\\\\n### Texture Metrics:\\\\n- Exterior should be crispy and lightly browned\\\\n- Interior should remain juicy and tender\\\\n- Chicken should be fully cooked (165\\xc2\\xb0F/74\\xc2\\xb0C internal temperature)\\\\n\\\\n### Flavor Metrics:\\\\n- Medium spice level that provides warmth without overwhelming heat\\\\n- Balanced flavor profile with tangy, spicy, and aromatic elements\\\\n- Authentic curry leaf and mustard seed notes\\\\n\\\\n### Appearance Metrics:\\\\n- Vibrant reddish-orange color\\\\n- Even browning\\\\n- Visible spice coating\\\\n\\\\n## Risk Mitigation\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Issues and Solutions:\\\\n1. **Undercooking:**\\\\n   - Solution: Use a meat thermometer to verify internal temperature\\\\n   - Contingency: Add 2-3 minutes additional cooking time if needed\\\\n\\\\n2. **Dry Texture:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure adequate marination time (minimum 4 hours)\\\\n   - Contingency: Rest chicken at room temperature 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n\\\\n3. **Insufficient Crispiness:**\\\\n   - Solution: Ensure chicken pieces aren\\'t overcrowded in air fryer\\\\n   - Contingency: Increase temperature to 400\\xc2\\xb0F for last 2 minutes of cooking\\\\n\\\\n4. **Spice Level Adjustment:**\\\\n   - Solution: Prepare a small sample piece to test spice level\\\\n   - Contingency: Add yogurt-based dipping sauce to moderate heat if too spicy\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Schedule\\\\n\\\\n1. **Day Before:**\\\\n   - Purchase ingredients\\\\n   - Clean and cut chicken\\\\n   - Prepare marinade and combine with chicken\\\\n   - Refrigerate overnight\\\\n\\\\n2. **Day of Serving:**\\\\n   - Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before cooking\\\\n   - Prepare air fryer and additional coating ingredients\\\\n   - Cook chicken in batches as needed\\\\n   - Prepare tempering if desired\\\\n   - Garnish and serve immediately\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis strategy provides a comprehensive approach to creating Chicken 65 that balances authentic flavor with healthier cooking methods.

Design for learning purposes\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/implementation_details.md:\\\\n# Implementation Details: JavaScript Hello World in Browser Console\\\\n\\\\n## 1. Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\nBased on the requirements, this project needs:\\\\n\\\\n- A JavaScript script that displays \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in the browser console\\\\n- The script must use JavaScript as the programming language\\\\n- It must be executable in a web browser\\'s console\\\\n- It should be simple with no additional functionality\\\\n- It\\'s designed for learning purposes\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Technical Approach\\\\n\\\\nSince this is a learning-focused project, I\\'ll provide multiple implementation options with educational context.\\\\n\\\\n### 2.1 Basic Implementation\\\\n\\\\nThe simplest implementation is a single line of JavaScript code:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis code:\\\\n- Uses JavaScript\\'s built-in `console.log()` method\\\\n- Prints the string \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser\\'s console\\\\n- Works in all modern browsers\\\\n- Requires no additional setup or dependencies\\\\n\\\\n### 2.2 Implementation Options\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 1: Direct Console Entry\\\\nThe script can be executed by:\\\\n1. Opening any web browser\\\\n2. Opening the developer console (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or right-click \\xe2\\x86\\x92 Inspect)\\\\n3. Navigating to the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab\\\\n4. Typing or pasting `console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");`\\\\n5. Pressing Enter to execute\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 2: HTML Page with Inline Script\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\n        console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 3: HTML Page with External Script\\\\n\\\\nHTML file (index.html):\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nJavaScript file (script.js):\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Learning Extensions\\\\n\\\\nTo enhance the learning experience, here are variations and extensions:\\\\n\\\\n### 3.1 Alternative Console Methods\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Standard console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Styled console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"%cHello World\\\\\", \\\\\"color: blue; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Warning level output\\\\nconsole.warn(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Error level output\\\\nconsole.error(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Information level output\\\\nconsole.info(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Console output with multiple values\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 3.2 Adding User Interaction\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Alert box (doesn\\'t use console but useful to learn)\\\\nalert(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Prompt user for name then greet them in console\\\\nconst name = prompt(\\\\\"Enter your name:\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\nconsole.log(`Hello ${name}`);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 4.

Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\nBased on the requirements, this project needs:\\\\n\\\\n- A JavaScript script that displays \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in the browser console\\\\n- The script must use JavaScript as the programming language\\\\n- It must be executable in a web browser\\'s console\\\\n- It should be simple with no additional functionality\\\\n- It\\'s designed for learning purposes\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Technical Approach\\\\n\\\\nSince this is a learning-focused project, I\\'ll provide multiple implementation options with educational context.\\\\n\\\\n### 2.1 Basic Implementation\\\\n\\\\nThe simplest implementation is a single line of JavaScript code:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis code:\\\\n- Uses JavaScript\\'s built-in `console.log()` method\\\\n- Prints the string \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser\\'s console\\\\n- Works in all modern browsers\\\\n- Requires no additional setup or dependencies\\\\n\\\\n### 2.2 Implementation Options\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 1: Direct Console Entry\\\\nThe script can be executed by:\\\\n1. Opening any web browser\\\\n2. Opening the developer console (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or right-click \\xe2\\x86\\x92 Inspect)\\\\n3. Navigating to the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab\\\\n4. Typing or pasting `console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");`\\\\n5. Pressing Enter to execute\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 2: HTML Page with Inline Script\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\n        console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 3: HTML Page with External Script\\\\n\\\\nHTML file (index.html):\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nJavaScript file (script.js):\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Learning Extensions\\\\n\\\\nTo enhance the learning experience, here are variations and extensions:\\\\n\\\\n### 3.1 Alternative Console Methods\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Standard console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Styled console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"%cHello World\\\\\", \\\\\"color: blue; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Warning level output\\\\nconsole.warn(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Error level output\\\\nconsole.error(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Information level output\\\\nconsole.info(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Console output with multiple values\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 3.2 Adding User Interaction\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Alert box (doesn\\'t use console but useful to learn)\\\\nalert(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Prompt user for name then greet them in console\\\\nconst name = prompt(\\\\\"Enter your name:\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\nconsole.log(`Hello ${name}`);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Implementation Steps\\\\n\\\\n1. **Choose an implementation option** based on learning needs:\\\\n   - Direct console entry for immediate results\\\\n   - HTML page with inline script for basic web context\\\\n   - HTML with external script for best practice demonstration\\\\n\\\\n2. **For direct console entry:**\\\\n   - Open any browser\\\\n   - Access the developer console\\\\n   - Type the code and press Enter\\\\n\\\\n3. **For HTML implementation:**\\\\n   - Create the HTML file using a text editor\\\\n   - Add the JavaScript either inline or as a separate file\\\\n   - Save the file(s) with appropriate extensions (.html, .js)\\\\n   - Open the HTML file in a browser\\\\n   - Check the console to see the output\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Browser Compatibility\\\\n\\\\nThis implementation is compatible with all modern browsers:\\\\n- Google Chrome\\\\n- Mozilla Firefox\\\\n- Microsoft Edge\\\\n- Safari\\\\n- Opera\\\\n\\\\n## 6. Testing\\\\n\\\\nTo verify the implementation works:\\\\n1. Execute the code using one of the implementation options\\\\n2. Open the browser\\'s developer console\\\\n3. Confirm \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears in the console output\\\\n\\\\n## 7.

Design for learning purposes\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/implementation_details.md:\\\\n# Implementation Details: JavaScript Hello World in Browser Console\\\\n\\\\n## 1. Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\nBased on the requirements, this project needs:\\\\n\\\\n- A JavaScript script that displays \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in the browser console\\\\n- The script must use JavaScript as the programming language\\\\n- It must be executable in a web browser\\'s console\\\\n- It should be simple with no additional functionality\\\\n- It\\'s designed for learning purposes\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Technical Approach\\\\n\\\\nSince this is a learning-focused project, I\\'ll provide multiple implementation options with educational context.\\\\n\\\\n### 2.1 Basic Implementation\\\\n\\\\nThe simplest implementation is a single line of JavaScript code:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis code:\\\\n- Uses JavaScript\\'s built-in `console.log()` method\\\\n- Prints the string \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser\\'s console\\\\n- Works in all modern browsers\\\\n- Requires no additional setup or dependencies\\\\n\\\\n### 2.2 Implementation Options\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 1: Direct Console Entry\\\\nThe script can be executed by:\\\\n1. Opening any web browser\\\\n2. Opening the developer console (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or right-click \\xe2\\x86\\x92 Inspect)\\\\n3. Navigating to the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab\\\\n4. Typing or pasting `console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");`\\\\n5. Pressing Enter to execute\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 2: HTML Page with Inline Script\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\n        console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 3: HTML Page with External Script\\\\n\\\\nHTML file (index.html):\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nJavaScript file (script.js):\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Learning Extensions\\\\n\\\\nTo enhance the learning experience, here are variations and extensions:\\\\n\\\\n### 3.1 Alternative Console Methods\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Standard console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Styled console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"%cHello World\\\\\", \\\\\"color: blue; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Warning level output\\\\nconsole.warn(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Error level output\\\\nconsole.error(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Information level output\\\\nconsole.info(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Console output with multiple values\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 3.2 Adding User Interaction\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Alert box (doesn\\'t use console but useful to learn)\\\\nalert(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Prompt user for name then greet them in console\\\\nconst name = prompt(\\\\\"Enter your name:\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\nconsole.log(`Hello ${name}`);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Implementation Steps\\\\n\\\\n1. **Choose an implementation option** based on learning needs:\\\\n   - Direct console entry for immediate results\\\\n   - HTML page with inline script for basic web context\\\\n   - HTML with external script for best practice demonstration\\\\n\\\\n2. **For direct console entry:**\\\\n   - Open any browser\\\\n   - Access the developer console\\\\n   - Type the code and press Enter\\\\n\\\\n3. **For HTML implementation:**\\\\n   - Create the HTML file using a text editor\\\\n   - Add the JavaScript either inline or as a separate file\\\\n   - Save the file(s) with appropriate extensions (.html, .js)\\\\n   - Open the HTML file in a browser\\\\n   - Check the console to see the output\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Browser Compatibility\\\\n\\\\nThis implementation is compatible with all modern browsers:\\\\n- Google Chrome\\\\n- Mozilla Firefox\\\\n- Microsoft Edge\\\\n- Safari\\\\n- Opera\\\\n\\\\n## 6. Testing\\\\n\\\\nTo verify the implementation works:\\\\n1. Execute the code using one of the implementation options\\\\n2. Open the browser\\'s developer console\\\\n3. Confirm \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears in the console output\\\\n\\\\n## 7. Educational Resources\\\\n\\\\nFor learners to deepen their understanding:\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - console.log()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log)\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)\\\\n\\\\n## 8. Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThis implementation fulfills all the required specifications for a JavaScript \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" program that runs in a browser console.

Design for learning purposes\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/implementation_details.md:\\\\n# Implementation Details: JavaScript Hello World in Browser Console\\\\n\\\\n## 1. Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\nBased on the requirements, this project needs:\\\\n\\\\n- A JavaScript script that displays \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in the browser console\\\\n- The script must use JavaScript as the programming language\\\\n- It must be executable in a web browser\\'s console\\\\n- It should be simple with no additional functionality\\\\n- It\\'s designed for learning purposes\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Technical Approach\\\\n\\\\nSince this is a learning-focused project, I\\'ll provide multiple implementation options with educational context.\\\\n\\\\n### 2.1 Basic Implementation\\\\n\\\\nThe simplest implementation is a single line of JavaScript code:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis code:\\\\n- Uses JavaScript\\'s built-in `console.log()` method\\\\n- Prints the string \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser\\'s console\\\\n- Works in all modern browsers\\\\n- Requires no additional setup or dependencies\\\\n\\\\n### 2.2 Implementation Options\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 1: Direct Console Entry\\\\nThe script can be executed by:\\\\n1. Opening any web browser\\\\n2. Opening the developer console (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or right-click \\xe2\\x86\\x92 Inspect)\\\\n3. Navigating to the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab\\\\n4. Typing or pasting `console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");`\\\\n5. Pressing Enter to execute\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 2: HTML Page with Inline Script\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\n        console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 3: HTML Page with External Script\\\\n\\\\nHTML file (index.html):\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nJavaScript file (script.js):\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Learning Extensions\\\\n\\\\nTo enhance the learning experience, here are variations and extensions:\\\\n\\\\n### 3.1 Alternative Console Methods\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Standard console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Styled console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"%cHello World\\\\\", \\\\\"color: blue; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Warning level output\\\\nconsole.warn(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Error level output\\\\nconsole.error(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Information level output\\\\nconsole.info(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Console output with multiple values\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 3.2 Adding User Interaction\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Alert box (doesn\\'t use console but useful to learn)\\\\nalert(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Prompt user for name then greet them in console\\\\nconst name = prompt(\\\\\"Enter your name:\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\nconsole.log(`Hello ${name}`);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Implementation Steps\\\\n\\\\n1. **Choose an implementation option** based on learning needs:\\\\n   - Direct console entry for immediate results\\\\n   - HTML page with inline script for basic web context\\\\n   - HTML with external script for best practice demonstration\\\\n\\\\n2. **For direct console entry:**\\\\n   - Open any browser\\\\n   - Access the developer console\\\\n   - Type the code and press Enter\\\\n\\\\n3. **For HTML implementation:**\\\\n   - Create the HTML file using a text editor\\\\n   - Add the JavaScript either inline or as a separate file\\\\n   - Save the file(s) with appropriate extensions (.html, .js)\\\\n   - Open the HTML file in a browser\\\\n   - Check the console to see the output\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Browser Compatibility\\\\n\\\\nThis implementation is compatible with all modern browsers:\\\\n- Google Chrome\\\\n- Mozilla Firefox\\\\n- Microsoft Edge\\\\n- Safari\\\\n- Opera\\\\n\\\\n## 6. Testing\\\\n\\\\nTo verify the implementation works:\\\\n1. Execute the code using one of the implementation options\\\\n2. Open the browser\\'s developer console\\\\n3. Confirm \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears in the console output\\\\n\\\\n## 7. Educational Resources\\\\n\\\\nFor learners to deepen their understanding:\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - console.log()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log)\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)\\\\n\\\\n## 8. Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThis implementation fulfills all the required specifications for a JavaScript \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" program that runs in a browser console.

Design for learning purposes\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/implementation_details.md:\\\\n# Implementation Details: JavaScript Hello World in Browser Console\\\\n\\\\n## 1. Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\nBased on the requirements, this project needs:\\\\n\\\\n- A JavaScript script that displays \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in the browser console\\\\n- The script must use JavaScript as the programming language\\\\n- It must be executable in a web browser\\'s console\\\\n- It should be simple with no additional functionality\\\\n- It\\'s designed for learning purposes\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Technical Approach\\\\n\\\\nSince this is a learning-focused project, I\\'ll provide multiple implementation options with educational context.\\\\n\\\\n### 2.1 Basic Implementation\\\\n\\\\nThe simplest implementation is a single line of JavaScript code:\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis code:\\\\n- Uses JavaScript\\'s built-in `console.log()` method\\\\n- Prints the string \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser\\'s console\\\\n- Works in all modern browsers\\\\n- Requires no additional setup or dependencies\\\\n\\\\n### 2.2 Implementation Options\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 1: Direct Console Entry\\\\nThe script can be executed by:\\\\n1. Opening any web browser\\\\n2. Opening the developer console (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or right-click \\xe2\\x86\\x92 Inspect)\\\\n3. Navigating to the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab\\\\n4. Typing or pasting `console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");`\\\\n5. Pressing Enter to execute\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 2: HTML Page with Inline Script\\\\n\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\n        console.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Option 3: HTML Page with External Script\\\\n\\\\nHTML file (index.html):\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <h1>JavaScript Hello World Example</h1>\\\\n    <p>Open your browser\\'s console to see the \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" message.</p>\\\\n    <p>You can typically open the console by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting \\\\\"Inspect\\\\\" then clicking on the \\\\\"Console\\\\\" tab.</p>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nJavaScript file (script.js):\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// This JavaScript code prints \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the browser console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 3. Learning Extensions\\\\n\\\\nTo enhance the learning experience, here are variations and extensions:\\\\n\\\\n### 3.1 Alternative Console Methods\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Standard console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Styled console output\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"%cHello World\\\\\", \\\\\"color: blue; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Warning level output\\\\nconsole.warn(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Error level output\\\\nconsole.error(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Information level output\\\\nconsole.info(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Console output with multiple values\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 3.2 Adding User Interaction\\\\n\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Alert box (doesn\\'t use console but useful to learn)\\\\nalert(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\n// Prompt user for name then greet them in console\\\\nconst name = prompt(\\\\\"Enter your name:\\\\\", \\\\\"World\\\\\");\\\\nconsole.log(`Hello ${name}`);\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Implementation Steps\\\\n\\\\n1. **Choose an implementation option** based on learning needs:\\\\n   - Direct console entry for immediate results\\\\n   - HTML page with inline script for basic web context\\\\n   - HTML with external script for best practice demonstration\\\\n\\\\n2. **For direct console entry:**\\\\n   - Open any browser\\\\n   - Access the developer console\\\\n   - Type the code and press Enter\\\\n\\\\n3. **For HTML implementation:**\\\\n   - Create the HTML file using a text editor\\\\n   - Add the JavaScript either inline or as a separate file\\\\n   - Save the file(s) with appropriate extensions (.html, .js)\\\\n   - Open the HTML file in a browser\\\\n   - Check the console to see the output\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Browser Compatibility\\\\n\\\\nThis implementation is compatible with all modern browsers:\\\\n- Google Chrome\\\\n- Mozilla Firefox\\\\n- Microsoft Edge\\\\n- Safari\\\\n- Opera\\\\n\\\\n## 6. Testing\\\\n\\\\nTo verify the implementation works:\\\\n1. Execute the code using one of the implementation options\\\\n2. Open the browser\\'s developer console\\\\n3. Confirm \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears in the console output\\\\n\\\\n## 7. Educational Resources\\\\n\\\\nFor learners to deepen their understanding:\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - console.log()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log)\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)\\\\n- [MDN Web Docs - What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)\\\\n\\\\n## 8. Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThis implementation fulfills all the required specifications for a JavaScript \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" program that runs in a browser console.

Based on the customer requirements, we will deliver two different solutions: a two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files, and a single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Core Requirements\\\\n1. Create a basic \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" script that runs directly in Chrome\\\\n2. Provide two implementation options:\\\\n   - Two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files\\\\n   - Single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript\\\\n3. The script should display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n4. The two-file solution should also log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\n5. The implementation should be standalone with no dependencies\\\\n6. Files should follow specific naming conventions\\\\n7. The script should execute when the page loads\\\\n8. Implementation should use standard JavaScript that works in Chrome\\\\n\\\\n### Customer Context\\\\n- The purpose is \\\\\"just testing\\\\\"\\\\n- The customer has expertise in JavaScript and Chrome\\\\n- No specific styling or advanced features are required\\\\n- The implementation needs to be simple and straightforward\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Two-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### index.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Two File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\"></div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <!-- Reference to external JavaScript file -->\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### script.js\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\ndocument.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\n// Log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Single-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### standalone.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Single File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\">Hello World</div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This is optional since we already have the text in the HTML\\\\n        // But including it to show how JavaScript can modify content\\\\n        document.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Details\\\\n\\\\n### HTML Structure\\\\n- Each solution includes proper HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration\\\\n- Meta tags for character encoding and responsive viewport\\\\n- Semantic structure with appropriate title\\\\n- Element with an ID for JavaScript to target\\\\n\\\\n### JavaScript Implementation\\\\n- DOM manipulation to display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n- Console logging (in the two-file solution)\\\\n- Script positioning at the end of the body to ensure DOM is loaded before execution\\\\n- No external dependencies or libraries\\\\n\\\\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\\\\n\\\\n### For Two-File Solution\\\\n- **Window.onload approach**: Could use `window.onload = function() {...}` to ensure DOM is fully loaded\\\\n- **DOMContentLoaded listener**: Could use `document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', function() {...})`\\\\n- **Defer attribute**: Could add `defer` attribute to script tag\\\\n\\\\n### For Single-File Solution\\\\n- **Direct HTML approach**: Could simply place \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in HTML without JavaScript\\\\n- **Document.write()**: Could use `document.write(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\")` for simpler but less recommended code\\\\n- **Self-executing function**: Could wrap JavaScript in `(function() {...})()` for better scoping\\\\n\\\\n## Testing Strategy\\\\n1. Open the HTML files in Chrome browser\\\\n2. Verify \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears on the webpage\\\\n3. For the two-file solution, open Chrome Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for the logged message\\\\n\\\\n## Deployment Instructions\\\\n1. Create the files according to the specifications above\\\\n2. Ensure both files for the two-file solution are in the same directory\\\\n3. Open the HTML files directly in Chrome browser\\\\n\\\\n## Maintenance Considerations\\\\n- The implementation is minimal and should require no maintenance\\\\n- Code follows standard practices for simple web applications\\\\n- No compatibility issues expected as it only targets Chrome\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis implementation strategy meets all the customer requirements with clean, minimal code that aligns with the customer\\'s expertise and testing purposes. Both solutions provide the required functionality while following web development best practices for simple applications.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n```md\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want create a basic hello world script.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

Based on the customer requirements, we will deliver two different solutions: a two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files, and a single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Core Requirements\\\\n1. Create a basic \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" script that runs directly in Chrome\\\\n2. Provide two implementation options:\\\\n   - Two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files\\\\n   - Single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript\\\\n3. The script should display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n4. The two-file solution should also log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\n5. The implementation should be standalone with no dependencies\\\\n6. Files should follow specific naming conventions\\\\n7. The script should execute when the page loads\\\\n8. Implementation should use standard JavaScript that works in Chrome\\\\n\\\\n### Customer Context\\\\n- The purpose is \\\\\"just testing\\\\\"\\\\n- The customer has expertise in JavaScript and Chrome\\\\n- No specific styling or advanced features are required\\\\n- The implementation needs to be simple and straightforward\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Two-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### index.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Two File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\"></div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <!-- Reference to external JavaScript file -->\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### script.js\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\ndocument.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\n// Log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Single-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### standalone.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Single File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\">Hello World</div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This is optional since we already have the text in the HTML\\\\n        // But including it to show how JavaScript can modify content\\\\n        document.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Details\\\\n\\\\n### HTML Structure\\\\n- Each solution includes proper HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration\\\\n- Meta tags for character encoding and responsive viewport\\\\n- Semantic structure with appropriate title\\\\n- Element with an ID for JavaScript to target\\\\n\\\\n### JavaScript Implementation\\\\n- DOM manipulation to display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n- Console logging (in the two-file solution)\\\\n- Script positioning at the end of the body to ensure DOM is loaded before execution\\\\n- No external dependencies or libraries\\\\n\\\\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\\\\n\\\\n### For Two-File Solution\\\\n- **Window.onload approach**: Could use `window.onload = function() {...}` to ensure DOM is fully loaded\\\\n- **DOMContentLoaded listener**: Could use `document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', function() {...})`\\\\n- **Defer attribute**: Could add `defer` attribute to script tag\\\\n\\\\n### For Single-File Solution\\\\n- **Direct HTML approach**: Could simply place \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in HTML without JavaScript\\\\n- **Document.write()**: Could use `document.write(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\")` for simpler but less recommended code\\\\n- **Self-executing function**: Could wrap JavaScript in `(function() {...})()` for better scoping\\\\n\\\\n## Testing Strategy\\\\n1. Open the HTML files in Chrome browser\\\\n2. Verify \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears on the webpage\\\\n3. For the two-file solution, open Chrome Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for the logged message\\\\n\\\\n## Deployment Instructions\\\\n1. Create the files according to the specifications above\\\\n2. Ensure both files for the two-file solution are in the same directory\\\\n3. Open the HTML files directly in Chrome browser\\\\n\\\\n## Maintenance Considerations\\\\n- The implementation is minimal and should require no maintenance\\\\n- Code follows standard practices for simple web applications\\\\n- No compatibility issues expected as it only targets Chrome\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis implementation strategy meets all the customer requirements with clean, minimal code that aligns with the customer\\'s expertise and testing purposes. Both solutions provide the required functionality while following web development best practices for simple applications.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n```md\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want create a basic hello world script.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

Based on the customer requirements, we will deliver two different solutions: a two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files, and a single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Core Requirements\\\\n1. Create a basic \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" script that runs directly in Chrome\\\\n2. Provide two implementation options:\\\\n   - Two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files\\\\n   - Single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript\\\\n3. The script should display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n4. The two-file solution should also log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\n5. The implementation should be standalone with no dependencies\\\\n6. Files should follow specific naming conventions\\\\n7. The script should execute when the page loads\\\\n8. Implementation should use standard JavaScript that works in Chrome\\\\n\\\\n### Customer Context\\\\n- The purpose is \\\\\"just testing\\\\\"\\\\n- The customer has expertise in JavaScript and Chrome\\\\n- No specific styling or advanced features are required\\\\n- The implementation needs to be simple and straightforward\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Two-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### index.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Two File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\"></div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <!-- Reference to external JavaScript file -->\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### script.js\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\ndocument.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\n// Log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Single-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### standalone.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Single File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\">Hello World</div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This is optional since we already have the text in the HTML\\\\n        // But including it to show how JavaScript can modify content\\\\n        document.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Details\\\\n\\\\n### HTML Structure\\\\n- Each solution includes proper HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration\\\\n- Meta tags for character encoding and responsive viewport\\\\n- Semantic structure with appropriate title\\\\n- Element with an ID for JavaScript to target\\\\n\\\\n### JavaScript Implementation\\\\n- DOM manipulation to display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n- Console logging (in the two-file solution)\\\\n- Script positioning at the end of the body to ensure DOM is loaded before execution\\\\n- No external dependencies or libraries\\\\n\\\\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\\\\n\\\\n### For Two-File Solution\\\\n- **Window.onload approach**: Could use `window.onload = function() {...}` to ensure DOM is fully loaded\\\\n- **DOMContentLoaded listener**: Could use `document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', function() {...})`\\\\n- **Defer attribute**: Could add `defer` attribute to script tag\\\\n\\\\n### For Single-File Solution\\\\n- **Direct HTML approach**: Could simply place \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in HTML without JavaScript\\\\n- **Document.write()**: Could use `document.write(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\")` for simpler but less recommended code\\\\n- **Self-executing function**: Could wrap JavaScript in `(function() {...})()` for better scoping\\\\n\\\\n## Testing Strategy\\\\n1. Open the HTML files in Chrome browser\\\\n2. Verify \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears on the webpage\\\\n3. For the two-file solution, open Chrome Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for the logged message\\\\n\\\\n## Deployment Instructions\\\\n1. Create the files according to the specifications above\\\\n2. Ensure both files for the two-file solution are in the same directory\\\\n3. Open the HTML files directly in Chrome browser\\\\n\\\\n## Maintenance Considerations\\\\n- The implementation is minimal and should require no maintenance\\\\n- Code follows standard practices for simple web applications\\\\n- No compatibility issues expected as it only targets Chrome\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis implementation strategy meets all the customer requirements with clean, minimal code that aligns with the customer\\'s expertise and testing purposes. Both solutions provide the required functionality while following web development best practices for simple applications.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n```md\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want create a basic hello world script.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

Based on the customer requirements, we will deliver two different solutions: a two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files, and a single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Core Requirements\\\\n1. Create a basic \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" script that runs directly in Chrome\\\\n2. Provide two implementation options:\\\\n   - Two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files\\\\n   - Single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript\\\\n3. The script should display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n4. The two-file solution should also log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\n5. The implementation should be standalone with no dependencies\\\\n6. Files should follow specific naming conventions\\\\n7. The script should execute when the page loads\\\\n8. Implementation should use standard JavaScript that works in Chrome\\\\n\\\\n### Customer Context\\\\n- The purpose is \\\\\"just testing\\\\\"\\\\n- The customer has expertise in JavaScript and Chrome\\\\n- No specific styling or advanced features are required\\\\n- The implementation needs to be simple and straightforward\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Two-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### index.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Two File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\"></div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <!-- Reference to external JavaScript file -->\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### script.js\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\ndocument.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\n// Log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Single-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### standalone.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Single File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\">Hello World</div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This is optional since we already have the text in the HTML\\\\n        // But including it to show how JavaScript can modify content\\\\n        document.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Details\\\\n\\\\n### HTML Structure\\\\n- Each solution includes proper HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration\\\\n- Meta tags for character encoding and responsive viewport\\\\n- Semantic structure with appropriate title\\\\n- Element with an ID for JavaScript to target\\\\n\\\\n### JavaScript Implementation\\\\n- DOM manipulation to display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n- Console logging (in the two-file solution)\\\\n- Script positioning at the end of the body to ensure DOM is loaded before execution\\\\n- No external dependencies or libraries\\\\n\\\\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\\\\n\\\\n### For Two-File Solution\\\\n- **Window.onload approach**: Could use `window.onload = function() {...}` to ensure DOM is fully loaded\\\\n- **DOMContentLoaded listener**: Could use `document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', function() {...})`\\\\n- **Defer attribute**: Could add `defer` attribute to script tag\\\\n\\\\n### For Single-File Solution\\\\n- **Direct HTML approach**: Could simply place \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in HTML without JavaScript\\\\n- **Document.write()**: Could use `document.write(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\")` for simpler but less recommended code\\\\n- **Self-executing function**: Could wrap JavaScript in `(function() {...})()` for better scoping\\\\n\\\\n## Testing Strategy\\\\n1. Open the HTML files in Chrome browser\\\\n2. Verify \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears on the webpage\\\\n3. For the two-file solution, open Chrome Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for the logged message\\\\n\\\\n## Deployment Instructions\\\\n1. Create the files according to the specifications above\\\\n2. Ensure both files for the two-file solution are in the same directory\\\\n3. Open the HTML files directly in Chrome browser\\\\n\\\\n## Maintenance Considerations\\\\n- The implementation is minimal and should require no maintenance\\\\n- Code follows standard practices for simple web applications\\\\n- No compatibility issues expected as it only targets Chrome\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis implementation strategy meets all the customer requirements with clean, minimal code that aligns with the customer\\'s expertise and testing purposes. Both solutions provide the required functionality while following web development best practices for simple applications.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n```md\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want create a basic hello world script.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

Based on the customer requirements, we will deliver two different solutions: a two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files, and a single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript.\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements Analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Core Requirements\\\\n1. Create a basic \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" script that runs directly in Chrome\\\\n2. Provide two implementation options:\\\\n   - Two-file solution with separate HTML and JavaScript files\\\\n   - Single-file solution with HTML and embedded JavaScript\\\\n3. The script should display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n4. The two-file solution should also log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\n5. The implementation should be standalone with no dependencies\\\\n6. Files should follow specific naming conventions\\\\n7. The script should execute when the page loads\\\\n8. Implementation should use standard JavaScript that works in Chrome\\\\n\\\\n### Customer Context\\\\n- The purpose is \\\\\"just testing\\\\\"\\\\n- The customer has expertise in JavaScript and Chrome\\\\n- No specific styling or advanced features are required\\\\n- The implementation needs to be simple and straightforward\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Strategy\\\\n\\\\n### Two-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### index.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Two File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\"></div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <!-- Reference to external JavaScript file -->\\\\n    <script src=\\\\\"script.js\\\\\"></script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### script.js\\\\n```javascript\\\\n// Display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\ndocument.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\n// Log \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" to the console\\\\nconsole.log(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\");\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Single-File Solution\\\\n\\\\n#### standalone.html\\\\n```html\\\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\\\n<html lang=\\\\\"en\\\\\">\\\\n<head>\\\\n    <meta charset=\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\">\\\\n    <meta name=\\\\\"viewport\\\\\" content=\\\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\\\">\\\\n    <title>Hello World - Single File Solution</title>\\\\n</head>\\\\n<body>\\\\n    <div id=\\\\\"message\\\\\">Hello World</div>\\\\n    \\\\n    <script>\\\\n        // This is optional since we already have the text in the HTML\\\\n        // But including it to show how JavaScript can modify content\\\\n        document.getElementById(\\'message\\').textContent = \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\";\\\\n    </script>\\\\n</body>\\\\n</html>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Implementation Details\\\\n\\\\n### HTML Structure\\\\n- Each solution includes proper HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration\\\\n- Meta tags for character encoding and responsive viewport\\\\n- Semantic structure with appropriate title\\\\n- Element with an ID for JavaScript to target\\\\n\\\\n### JavaScript Implementation\\\\n- DOM manipulation to display \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" on the webpage\\\\n- Console logging (in the two-file solution)\\\\n- Script positioning at the end of the body to ensure DOM is loaded before execution\\\\n- No external dependencies or libraries\\\\n\\\\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\\\\n\\\\n### For Two-File Solution\\\\n- **Window.onload approach**: Could use `window.onload = function() {...}` to ensure DOM is fully loaded\\\\n- **DOMContentLoaded listener**: Could use `document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', function() {...})`\\\\n- **Defer attribute**: Could add `defer` attribute to script tag\\\\n\\\\n### For Single-File Solution\\\\n- **Direct HTML approach**: Could simply place \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" in HTML without JavaScript\\\\n- **Document.write()**: Could use `document.write(\\\\\"Hello World\\\\\")` for simpler but less recommended code\\\\n- **Self-executing function**: Could wrap JavaScript in `(function() {...})()` for better scoping\\\\n\\\\n## Testing Strategy\\\\n1. Open the HTML files in Chrome browser\\\\n2. Verify \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears on the webpage\\\\n3. For the two-file solution, open Chrome Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for the logged message\\\\n\\\\n## Deployment Instructions\\\\n1. Create the files according to the specifications above\\\\n2. Ensure both files for the two-file solution are in the same directory\\\\n3. Open the HTML files directly in Chrome browser\\\\n\\\\n## Maintenance Considerations\\\\n- The implementation is minimal and should require no maintenance\\\\n- Code follows standard practices for simple web applications\\\\n- No compatibility issues expected as it only targets Chrome\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis implementation strategy meets all the customer requirements with clean, minimal code that aligns with the customer\\'s expertise and testing purposes. Both solutions provide the required functionality while following web development best practices for simple applications.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md:\\\\n```md\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want create a basic hello world script.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.

Open the HTML files in Chrome browser\\\\n2. Verify \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" appears on the webpage\\\\n3. For the two-file solution, open Chrome Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for the logged message\\\\n\\\\n## Deployment Instructions\\\\n1. Create the files according to the specifications above\\\\n2. Ensure both files for the two-file solution are in the same directory\\\\n3. Open the HTML files directly in Chrome browser\\\\n\\\\n## Maintenance Considerations\\\\n- The implementation is minimal and should require no maintenance\\\\n- Code follows standard practices for simple web applications\\\\n- No compatibility issues expected as it only targets Chrome\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\nThis implementation strategy meets all the customer requirements with clean, minimal code that aligns with the customer\\'s expertise and testing purposes. Both solutions provide the required functionality while following web development best practices for simple applications.\"}],\"is_error\":false}]},{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Let\\'s check if there are any clarifications:\"},{\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"name\":\"filesystem-read_file\",\"input\":{\"path\":\"/Users/sysadmin/Desktop/projects/rabbithole-v2/data/files/clarifications.md\"},\"id\":\"toolu_01DkDyeG61FhC1TwCwRfyfM8\"}]},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01DkDyeG61FhC1TwCwRfyfM8\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"```md\\\\n# Customer Intent\\\\nI want create a basic hello world script.\\\\n\\\\n# Clarifying Questions and Answers\\\\n1.
